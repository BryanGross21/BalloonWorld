Not really an asset but the game is a fan game of Five Nights at Freddy's and as such includes characters and iconography from the series or inspired iconography, I claim to not own any of these characters or sets. I am in no way affiliated with Scott Cawthon or his partners and all credit goes out to him and his partners for making these amazing games
